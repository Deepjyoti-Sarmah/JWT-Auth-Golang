# JWT-Auth-Golang
A JSON Web Token used to do authentication and autherization based on token.
We created a Login API through which user can login. 
Once the user is loged in an jwt token is created for it 
After that for every request jwt token is passed from the client so that server can authenticate and autherize the requests
The Homepage API will authenticate and autherize the token 
We will also create a Referesh API to refresh and reuse the token
