# JWT-Auth-Golang

A JSON Web Token used to do authentication and autherization based on token. <br>
Created a Login API through which user can login. <br>
Once the user is loged in, a jwt token is created for it <br>
After that for every request jwt token is passed from the client so that server can authenticate and autherize the requests <br>
The Homepage API will authenticate and autherize the token <br>
We will also create a Referesh API to refresh and reuse the token
